The girl is well known under the name Honey Boo Boo Child, and is a constant child beauty contestant and the star of the reality show “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” (2012 – 2014). The first time Alana participated in a beauty pageant was when the girl was only three years old.</p><p>Is this nine-year-old girl rich? It has been estimated that the overall amount of Honey Boo Boo Child’s net worth is as much as $800,000. The main source of her net worth is television, as it has been reported that she earned $50,000 per episode of “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” (2012 – 2014). More, she has added sums to her net worth from various endorsement deals.</p><h3>Honey Boo Boo Child Net Worth $800,000</h3><p>Alana was raised in McIntyre, Georgia, in the rural place together with her three half sisters: Jessica, Lauryn and Anna. Alana’s parents Mike Thompson and June Shannon married in 2013.</p><p>Alana Thompson rose to prominence while taking part in the reality television series “Toddlers & Tiaras” (2009 – 2013) broadcast on TLC. The series focused on the lives of the children in beauty pageants, and the lives of their families. The show received some negative reactions as children were taught to act like adults; for example, one was asked to smoke cigarettes on the stage. However, despite the negative reactions from psychologists, the show has had several spin-off series including “Eden’s World” (2012), “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” (2012 – 2014) and “Cheer Perfection” (2012).</p><p>“Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” (2012 – 2014) was focused on the Thompson’s family life, and the action mainly takes place in their hometown of McIntyre, Georgia USA. The reaction to this reality show was controversial though the show gathered more than two million viewers per episode. Some critics described the show as exploitative, outrageous and offensive while others recommended the show as interesting to watch. The show was criticised for stimulating young children to act as though they were in adult beauty pageants, and for improper child diets. To give an example, Honey Boo Boo was encouraged to drink a mixture which contains caffeine equal to two cups of coffee. On the other hand, the show was praised for the positive attitude towards gays and for the great knowledge of home economics. The show was cancelled after June Shannon, the mother of Honey Boo Boo Child, became involved in a relationship with Mark Anthony McDaniel Sr. who was convicted of child molestation – it was the eldest daughter of June Shannon who was molested by McDaniel. He is now included on the list of sex offenders of the Georgia Sex Offender Registry.</p><p>In 2015, June Shannon together with her daughter Alana Thompson participated in an episode of the syndicated talk show “The Doctors” (2015). The problem of Alana’s weight was discussed as it had reached 125 pounds. The family was advised to eat healthier food and over the period of two months Alana lost approximately 20 pounds.</p><p>There is little privacy in Honey Boo Boo’s personal life – another criticism levelled at her family and the TV show. Hopefully at some point she will be able to lead something of a normal life for a child of her age.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$800,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 28, 2005</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>McIntyre, Georgia USA</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqGmp52pYq%2Bwu4ybpqhlk522rbCMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./marco-di-lauro.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marco Di Lauro">&larr;
