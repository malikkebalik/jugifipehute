We want meat!”</p><p>The oiled, muscled dancers would comply, stripping down on stage before venturing through the audience to kiss customers and accept dollar bills in their G-string pouches.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-spotify wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The podcast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Welcome to Your Fantasy,”</a> dropping Wednesday, digs into the wild history of the revue. Host and co-producer Natalia Petrzela told The Post: “It was forbidden for dancers to take money for sex but some did. I heard of guys making $300 to $1,500 for encounters.”</p><p>As ex-dancer Scott Marlowe reveals in the podcast, a woman once told him, “I’ll give you $100 for every inch of cocaine I can snort off of your c–k.”</p><p>But all that paled beside what went down between Somen “Steve” Banerjee and Nick De Noia. The former launched Chippendales in 1979 at a Los Angeles bar. The latter turned it into a global phenomenon. By the 1990s the business would be plagued by a murder, arson attempts and an FBI investigation.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Steve Banerjee (left) started Chippendales to increase his bar business, then brought in showman Nick De Noia (right) to jazz up the revue. Then Banerjee had De Noia killed.</figure><p>Banerjee, a socially awkward but ambitious émigré from India, stole the idea of men stripping for women from a bar in Redondo Beach and employed it — after trying backgammon, dinner theater and mud wrestling — in a bid to keep his own struggling joint afloat. Out of the gate, there were lines around the block. A couple years later, he hired De Noia, an Emmy-winning children’s-television producer, to take the show from beefcake amateur hour to Vegas-worthy extravaganza.</p><p>The two were like oil and water, feuding over money and control. De Noia proposed a deal in which he would launch a New York version of the show and keep half the revenue. But that was not all.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Old Chippendales Building.</figure><p>“Nick wrote on a napkin that he has the right to take Chippendales on the road and own it in perpetuity,” former revue host Dan Peterson says in the podcast. “Steve signed it and [gave] away the most profitable part of the business because he did not know what perpetuity meant.”</p><p>Over the next four years, the enterprise made millions. Charismatic De Noia received all the acclaim — celebrated on Sally Jessy Raphael’s and Phil Donahue’s talk shows. Meanwhile, the stuttering Banerjee “felt deeply scorned,” Petrzela said.</p><p>He was also facing financial stress: mounting back taxes, a $70,000 reprint fee due to a Chippendales calendar error (each month had 31 days) and a lawsuit from De Noia after Banerjee sent out his own Chippendales touring company.</p><p>“Steve decided to have Nick killed,” said K. Scot Macdonald, co-author of <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>“Deadly Dance: The Chippendales Murders.”</a></p><p>Banerjee mistakenly assumed that Bronx-born friend Ray Colon was mobbed up. “He fit the stereotype of a Mafia soldier,” said Mac­donald. “He was intense.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Pre-pandemic, some 250,000 a year saw the Chippendales revue in Las Vegas — likely not knowing the show’s dark history. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Colon hired a junkie named Louie to do the deed for Banerjee. In 1987, Louie strolled into De Noia’s Midtown office and shot him in the face.</p><p>A police investigation went nowhere. In 1988, De Noia’s family sold his share of Chippendales to Banerjee for $1.3 million. Macdonald estimates “it was worth 10 times that.”</p><p>Next, “Steve came up with the idea of killing the competition,” said Macdonald, referring to rival group Adonis: Men of Hollywood. Banerjee hired another amateur hit man, called Strawberry, to murder an Adonis choreographer and a dancer.</p><p>But Strawberry got cold feet. “He had a past as a DEA informant and called an agent he had formerly worked with,” said Macdonald. The FBI had Strawberry record calls to Colon. “He phoned Ray to [lie] that the two murders had taken place. That led the FBI to arrest Ray. Ray rolled over on Steve.” In 1993, Banerjee was arrested in his LA office.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Chippendales night Club in Los Angeles, 1980. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Before pleading guilty to racketeering, attempted arson and murder-for-hire, he transferred his possessions to his wife. They soon divorced and she sold Chippendales. “The night prior to his sentencing,” Macdonald said, “Steve killed himself.” Banerjee had hanged himself in a prison cell with a bedsheet.</p><p>Chippendales lives on via tours and in Las Vegas, where — pre-pandemic — some 250,000 people saw the show annually. It holds an interesting legacy, despite a dark past.</p><p>“Chippendales leveled the playing field of sexuality,” said Macdonald. “Before Chippendales, pornography was almost exclusively for men. Steve tapped into ... the fact that women want porn as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ5Gnwaqvy55mnZmioHqptdKtpquxXaSzbq%2FHoqepnZ6Zrq2x0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-wiggles-star-emma-watkins-marries-fianc%C3%A9-oliver-brian-at-intimate-ceremony.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Wiggles star Emma Watkins marries fianc Oliver Brian at intimate ceremony">&larr;
