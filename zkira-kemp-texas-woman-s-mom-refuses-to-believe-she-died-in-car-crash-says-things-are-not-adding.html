According to the Charles County Sheriff’s Office, Zkira Kemp, 20, was <a href=# rel>pronounced dead</a> at the scene of the July 8 crash in Maryland. An autopsy later revealed that she died of multiple injuries, including burns over 90% of her body, cerebral hemorrhage and blunt trauma.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Crime Online</a>, the crash was a single-vehicle accident caused when the driver went off the road and hit a tree, causing it to catch fire, around 2 am. The sheriff’s office said that the two other occupants were rushed to a hospital with <a href=# rel>serious injuries</a>. Kemp and her friends were students at Prairie Valley A&M in Prairie View, Texas, and were traveling to Maryland to spend her friend’s birthday with another friend.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Nepal plane crash: Co-pilot Anju Khatiwada’s husband died in similar 2006 crash flying for same airline</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Jordan Brister: Vegas teen found dead at school after suffering cardiac arrest following gym class</a></p><p>Kemp’s mother, Jalanda, reportedly said that she was informed that her daughter was the one who was <a href=# rel>driving the car while drunk</a>. She asked how her daughter's body ended up in the back seat of the car if she was really driving. The autopsy report said Zkira “had been consuming alcoholic beverages prior to” the crash. She also added that one of the friends told her the crash site was in the middle of nowhere but later, she came to know that it was a neighborhood when she arrived at the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I got there everything looked staged and I knew something just wasn’t right,” she said. However, aerial maps of the area showed that it was sparsely populated and heavily wooded, and likely appeared to be more remote in the middle of the night than it actually was. Jalanda said that she knew the friends were lying and wanted to know the truth. “They were lying about what happened to my daughter,” she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NC Beat</a>, adding, “I am trying to understand how my daughter is the only one that did not make it.”</p><p>Jalanda stated that that when she visited the crash location, a woman there told her that a man had been by who claimed that his son died in the same type of crash at the very same spot.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">A local newspaper</a> reportedly used an incorrect image in its story about Kemp's crash, using a picture of another crash that took place a few days before and a few miles away in which a 52-year-old man died when his vehicle crashed and burst into flames.</p><p>“I don’t feel like she’s gone. I don’t know if I’m holding on to hope, but I don’t feel it. I never felt it, but I thought I was crazy. I thought I just didn’t want to let go. But the more I’m seeing all of these different reports and more of these people come out with information, it is not adding up,”&nbsp;Jalanda told<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> KCEN.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRospuev6J5yp6kqWWkmsWiv4ywpqaZnqh6rrvToZyrZaKas7a%2FxKxkraddl7KttcSvnGarmJp6pbXEnWSipl2YrrN5wquYrKBdqLKmt9JmmKerp5q%2FtHnFqKylZaChrro%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alisa-bernstein.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alisa Bernstein">&larr;
