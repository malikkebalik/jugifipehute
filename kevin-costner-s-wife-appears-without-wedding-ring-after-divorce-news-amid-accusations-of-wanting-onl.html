However, it has also been reported that Costner was just as surprised about his separation as the rest of the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/66182fda647a1ef3b2fd9c961155b7c69ef2d3aaaaccc4fa5d30668ced693f74.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner in California in 2022 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>To prove it, the actor team released a <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2023/05/02/kevin-costner-christine-costner-wife-files-divorce-split/>statement</a>, "It is with great sadness that circumstances beyond his control have transpired which have resulted in Mr. Costner having to participate in a dissolution of marriage action."</p><p class=fh>But the team still asked for the family of five to be given privacy as they navigate this new life. So far, from what has been stated in the media, the two are on the same page, especially regarding their children.</p><p class=fh>The mother of three and her actor husband have both filed for joint custody. Baumgartner is also not asking for spousal support, which will reportedly only be paid according to the prenup agreement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/060e1f44b9cc352b5cf42256d0eabc50dbf5afbe950be10899eae70e424f45b7.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner in Aspen, Colorado in 2004 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>However, according to TMZ, the prenup leaves Baumgartner with nothing. All she needs is to pack up her bags and vacate all of Costner's homes, but their main house was in Santa Barbra.</p><p class=fh>Costner has taken the precaution of a prenup because his last divorce reportedly cost <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2023/05/03/kevin-costner-blindsided-divorce-prenup-christine-leave-house-property/>him $80 million</a>.

She said she drew a few designs and showed them to Costner. He loved them and believed they would be worth selling. Baumgartner loved fashion and adored it even more when it was functional. So within no time, Costner made things happen for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/23faf16c3a311bc5addd626ce0ca6b26290cdb3ddecc832e598222f727e45b5d.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner in Monte Carlo in 2000 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>When the two met and discussed business, Costner was still married to his first wife, Cindy Silva. But their first meeting was at a golf course where Costner was filming the 1996 romantic comedy "Tin Cup."</p><p class=fh>However, when the actor divorced his first wife, he dated Bridget Rooney, and they welcomed a child.

The ceremony was held at the 160-acre home in Aspen, and Costner arrived in a horse-driven carriage while the designer made a grand entrance in a green vintage truck.</p><p class=fh>The former couple lived in Colorado at the beginning of their marriage, but they left and moved to Santa Barbara. Although things were looking up for the couple, it was revealed that Baumgartner almost broke up with the actor.</p><p class=fh>Despite their <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/who-is-christine-baumgartner-kevin-costner-wife/>20-year age difference</a> Baumgartner was vocal about wanting children from their early dating days, so when it looked like the actor was not board, she was willing to leave.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e098cd2c9f808961101cfdeb8111fe5aa514191ecf5885167c033cc791316d59.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner in Madrid in 2005 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=#>Costner</a> realized he was unwilling to lose his wife over his fears, so three years after tying the knot, they welcomed their son, Cayden Wyatt, then their second son Hayes Logan and daughter Grace Avery.</p><p class=fh>But what makes their divorce an even bigger surprise was that the couple had said their relationship got stronger during quarantine.</p><p class=fh>Baumgartner took the initiative to home-school their children, which helped because she said Costner struggled to do things virtually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/119c5b498d396de109c27076f7580b99ba4d783e4bb40cf3571311fd6c6c3771.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Kevin Costner in California in 2023 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>The actor happily <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/who-is-christine-baumgartner-kevin-costner-wife/>said</a>, "Our partnership has really come into focus about what we do for each other and how we deal with our family."
