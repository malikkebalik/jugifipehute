Rhoda Phifer, his mother, who also served as a high school tutor, was responsible for raising him on her own.</p><p>Fernando Phifer, a Cameroonian, is Mekhi Phifer’s twin brother. The twins were born on December 29, 1974 in New York City. Despite being a single mother, the Phifers respected their mother for being a strict parent.</p><p>Fernando had to wait until the year 2000 to make his acting debut in the television film “Disappearing Acts,” whereas Mekhi made his debut in the television film “The Tuskegee Airmen.” In 2016, Fernando played the lead role in the short film “Sheet.”</p><p>The majority of Fernando’s life’s details are unknown, but it is clear that the Phifer family is very focused on acting and has a lot of acting hormones. The short film “Camp Victory” was another project on which Fernando served as a production designer.</p><p>Fernando and Mekhi were once close, but Mekhi’s social media pages don’t show the two brothers spending time together. Due to his low profile and lack of interest in being active on these platforms, Fernando is generally missing from any social media platforms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mekhi_Phifer%E2%80%99s_Family_Background></span>Mekhi Phifer’s Family Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Mekhi Phifer </a>was born in New York City’s Harlem by his mother. Mekhi was raised by his mother, a high-school teacher named Rhoda Phifer, as a single mom.</p><p>Omikaye is the name of Mekhi’s son. from his first union with Malinda Williams, an actress. In Los Angeles in 2007, Oni Souratha gave birth to his second son. Oni Souratha, his girlfriend, gave birth to Mekhi Thira Phifer Jr. in Los Angeles on October 30, 2007. On March 30, 2013, Mekhi wed his longtime partner Reshelet Barnes in Beverly Hills, California.</p><p>Mekhi Phifer, who was born on December 29, 1974, will be 48 years old in 2023. He weighs 81 kilograms and stands 1.76 meters tall</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mekhi_Phifer_Ethnicity></span>Mekhi Phifer Ethnicity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer is a US citizen and was born in Harlem, New York City. Mekhi appears to be of Afro-American ancestry, though this has not yet been established. Christianity seems to be Mekhi’s faith.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi, who was 18 at the time, won the role of a drug dealer involved in a murder cover-up in Spike Lee’s Clockers in 1994 after competing against over a thousand other actors and actresses.</p><p>In the comedy parody film High School High and the horror film I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, Phifer later played a different part.</p><p>In the fifth and sixth seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street, Mekhi Phifer played “Junior Bunk,” the troubled nephew of Baltimore drug lord Luther Mahoney. Mekhi Phifer also played a guest role in New York Undercover. Mekhi received an NAACP Image Award nomination for her work in the television movie A Lesson Before Dying.</p><p>The Grammy and Academy Award-winning song “Lose Yourself” by Eminem made reference to Phifer. He played Agent Collins in White Collar’s fourth season.</p><p>Phifer appeared as a cameo in the second season of the sitcom Husbands. In the fall of 2016, Phifer was hired as a regular on the TV show Frequency.</p><p>In the final round of the Celebrity Poker Showdown Championship in 2004, Mekhi defeated Neil Patrick Harris. Mekhi plays in the Hollywood Home games for the Love Our Children USA charity on the World Poker Tour.</p><p>Phifer serves as the board chairman of The Vine Group USA, a nonprofit organization established in 2000 to provide educational resources to African colleges. Mekhi has created a Full Tilt Poker account. He has a well on the 2+2 poker forum.</p><p>In California, Mekhi is the franchise owner of multiple Athlete’s Foot sports shoe stores. In January 2011, Mekhi started Third Reel Films.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Mekhi_Phifer_not_in_the_limelight_anymore></span>Why Mekhi Phifer not in the limelight anymore? <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer was one of Hollywood’s hottest stars in the middle of the 1990s. Following his practically overnight success in Spike Lee’s Clockers, he made appearances in the popular ensemble comedy Soul Food, the second-biggest slasher series of the time, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, and the infamous Brandy and Monica “boy is mine” fight scene.</p><p>The New Yorker was successful long into the twenty-first century, scoring significant parts in blockbuster films like 8 Mile, Honey, and Dawn of the Dead. Additionally, he starred in MTV-friendly interpretations of Othello and Carmen and appeared for six seasons as the sad Dr. Gregory Pratt in ER (we’re still grieving his passing).</p><p>Phifer has never been short of employment, but in comparison to his prime, his resume over the past five years has been somewhat low-key. Here’s a look at why it could be difficult for you to recall the last time you saw the formerly ubiquitous star on your screen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mekhi_Phifer_loves_stay_off_the_Media></span>Mekhi Phifer loves stay off the Media<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer has mostly succeeded in keeping his colorful private life out of the media despite having married and divorced his High School High co-star Malinda Williams, had a child with one-time fiancée Oni Southara, and was married a second time to NBC creative director Reshelet Barnes.</p><p>And the reason for that is that the Clockers lead intentionally chose not to engage in media manipulation. Regarding his lack of tabloid attention, Phifer told theGrio in a 2020 interview, “You aren’t going to find me out at the club, at the 40/40 or something like that.” The publication mentioned that Morris Chestnut and Omar Epps are two of the New Yorker’s friends in the entertainment industry. And he once had supper with none other than Sidney Poitier at the home of music producer Quincy Jones.</p><p>The Oscar winner told Phifer, “They won’t pay to watch your movies on Saturday if they see you at the club on Friday,” and Phifer claimed he has always been determined to follow that advice. It’s a rule that has kept the actor out of the public eye and controversy anytime he’s not working.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Business></span>Business <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi is the owner of a Athlete’s Foot store. Given that it’s simple to assume that people will always need shoes and that in that case many of them will want the best they can get, it would seem that shoe stores are a safe investment. This involves paying the highest prices for quality and for the types of shoes that are known to carry at least some level of prestige with them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer is an American actor with a $500k net worth. His roles in films like “8 Mile,” “Clockers,” and “Paid in Full” are arguably what made him most well-known. Mekhi Phifer has hit some financial snags recently, which we go into more depth about in the section below. Most notably, he declared bankruptcy in 2014, having reportedly owed more than $1 million to the IRS alone at that time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mekhi_Phifer></span>Mekhi Phifer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer and Malinda Williams, an actress, had a baby together. In 2007, Oni Souratha gave birth to his second son in Los Angeles. Phifer wed his long-term partner Reshelet Barnes in Beverly Hills, California, on March 30, 2013.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_Media></span>Social Media<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer is on Instagram with over 200k followers on his page.
