Like years before, the losses hit the industry hard, which is why we always take some time to pay tribute to those who are no longer with us. And while that is the case, there is no doubt they have left their mark on soaps forever…</p><p>January had us saying goodbye to stars such as <i>As the World Turns</i> and <i>Ryan’s Hope</i> actor Michael Levin, <i>Passions</i> fave Ben Masters, and <i>General Hospital</i> alum Annie Wersching, who lost her battle with cancer at just 45.</p><p>February brought news that <i>Days of Our Lives</i>’ Cody Longo passed away at a young 34, while March had the <i>General Hospital</i> family grieving the death of their Emmy Award-winning producer N’Neka Garland. April sent <i>As the World Turns</i>’ Martha Byrne to Twitter to honor the late Elizabeth Hubbard, who played her adoptive mother on the CBS soap.</p><p lang=art dir=ltr>❤️ <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/n9T45hgECf</a></p><p>— Martha Byrne (@MarthaByrne10) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 10, 2023</a></p><p>May had <i>General Hospital</i> and daytime in tears when Jacklyn Zeman (ex-Bobbie) passed away from cancer. “I’m so grateful to have shared so many years with this beautiful woman,” stated Laura Wright, who played Zeman’s on-screen daughter Carly. “Jackie told the best stories — she had an ‘incredible’ spirit and she lived such an amazing life.”</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Stars pay tribute to General Hospital’s Jacklyn Zeman</a></p><p><i>The Young and the Restless</i>’ Brett Hadley left the world in June but will always be remembered for playing the Williams family patriarch, Carl.</p><p>In July, the daughter of Andrea Evans, who held well-known roles on such soaps as <i>One Life to Live, Passions</i> and <i>The Bold and the Beautiful</i>, released a statement to our sister site, <a href=# rel=noopener>TVLine</a>, about the death of her mother following a courageous battle with cancer. “Her vibrant spirit, infectious laughter, and boundless love for life left a mark on all who were fortunate enough to know her,” Rodriguez shared. “Throughout her fight with cancer, my mom displayed awe-inspiring strength… We held hands until the very end.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/andrea-evans-oltl-tina-abc.jpeg alt="andrea evans" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Then came August when <i>Bold & Beautiful</i>’s Scott Clifton (Liam) remembered daytime icon, <i>The Price Is Right</i>’s Bob Barker and working with him on the CBS soap. “What a privilege it was, not only to work with him, not only to marvel at his wit and vitality even at 90 years old, but to have a once-in-a-lifetime private conversation with the man about his passion for animal ethics,” Clifton stated. “I wish every one of you could have met him, if only for a handshake.”</p><p>And while every death is sad and a loss for the genre, in September, daytime and fans were devastated to learn that Billy Miller had died at 43. The actor known for playing Billy Abbott on <i>Young & Restless</i>, as well as Richie Novak on <i>All My Children</i> and lastly Drew Cain on <i>General Hospital</i> was loved by many and grieved by many more. Jess Walton, who played Miller’s on-screen Genoa City mom Jill, as well as <a href=# rel=noopener>many others, paid tribute to the actor</a> and stated, “RIP to my precious Billy Miller. You were and ‘are’ much loved by all of us who knew you.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>RIP to my precious Billy Miller. You were and ARE&nbsp;&nbsp;much loved by all of us who knew you ❤️ <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/xaUTqM9Ho3</a></p><p>— Jess Walton (@JessWaltonYR) <a href=# rel=nofollow>September 18, 2023</a></p><p>October delivered more blows with reports of others passing, including ABC seasoned photographer, Craig Sjodin, as well as soap hopper Mark Goddard, <i>Dark Shadows</i>’ Lara Parker, <i>As the World Turns</i> and <i>Generations</i>’ Richard Roundtree and <i>Santa Barbara</i>’s Richard Moll, best known from his longtime role playing Bull on <i>Night Court</i>. And at the very end of the month, daytime was once again rocked to its core with news of Tyler Christopher’s death…</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>The primetime character deaths we’re still not over</a></p><p>On October 31, Christopher’s sudden passing left <i>General Hospital</i> with yet another devastating loss. Not only his former castmates but those who he worked with on <i>Days of Our Lives</i> and everyone who knew him mourned for their fallen friend. One in particular, Natalia Livingston, who played Nikolas’ onscreen Port Charles love Emily, shared, “I want everyone to know how sweet and gentle Ty was. How gifted, how dedicated, how much he cared about his craft and those around him. I was honored to work with him for many years and admired his talent tremendously. He made me laugh. He was one of the best chapters of my life and I’ll always be grateful to him. I’m so happy we reconnected after over a decade apart.”</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Daytime pays tribute to Tyler Christopher</a></p><p>The sadness didn’t stop and in November we remembered more daytime actors, including Evan Ellingson, who played a young Luke on <i>General Hospital</i> and passed away at 35, <i>All My Children</i>’s Peter White and <i>Another World</i>’s Frances Sternhagen.</p><p>In December, soaps’ first Black superstar, Ellen Holly, died at the age of 92. Though a woman of many talents, she’ll always be remembered for playing Carla Benari on <i>One Life to Live</i>, a role she received after Llanview creator Agnes Nixon read a letter Holly wrote to the <i>New York Times</i> about the difficulties she faced as a light-skinned Black actress.</p><p>Then on Christmas Eve, One Life to Live favorite Kamar de los Reyes (Antonio Vega) died at 56, following a brief battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife, Sherri Saum, who he met on the ABC soap, and their 9-year-old twin boys Michael and John, as well as his 26-year-old son Caylen, from a previous relationship.</p><p>The actor who played his onscreen brother, David Fumero (Cristian Vega) shared, “Can’t say goodbye my friend. But thank you for your love and wisdom. For the many laughs that would brighten my days.”</p><p>There were so many others who we paid tribute to throughout the year…</p><p><b>And we invite you to not only leave your own tributes to the stars in the comment section, but to browse through our photo gallery below, where you’ll have the opportunity to look deeper into those <a href=# rel=noopener>careers and roles that will never be forgotten</a>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYGyGeIWOrKaaqF2kvaa%2BwGaqrZmiqHqwrsitrJqqmZrAbrDEmquhq12hrrTAjKqsmqqkmr9ufo9ramg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./trisha-yearwood-is-nearly-unrecognizable-with-bangs-and-bold-glam.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trisha Yearwood Is Nearly Unrecognizable With Bangs and Bold Glam">&larr;
