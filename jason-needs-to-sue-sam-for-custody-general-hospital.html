My only problem with Sam is that lives with the son of the largest crime boss on the east coast and doesn’t seem concerned about the dangers of her children being around Sonny. Not only are living next door Sonny is welcomed in their home and they sometimes celebrate holidays together.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>The writers need to go slow with characters being redone.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Considering his line of work, him filing for custody would be a joke.

But can’t you imagine statues erected in Rice Plaza for them.

Both have expressed concerns about the children’s safty and Jason has left it up to them about how much he gets to be in their lives. I guess its just too easy to bash him than remembering that even before he disappeared both women had told him that his lifestyle was too dangerous. Not to mention Jason himself said that he did this because he knew his sons would be alright because of who their mothers were, he trusts them… It will be interesting to see what happens next. I’m also wondering if Sonny will get involved after he learns what Jason has really been doing and why.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/35a633/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Melanie:<p>both women had told him that his lifestyle was too dangerous</p><p>Did the women who have kids with Jason know what type of person he is and what he did for a living <strong>BEFORE</strong> they got involved with him and had a kid with him?</p><p>Same question about Sonny.</p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/b5e925/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> sjogirl:<p>I was kidding, sorry.

If all of the people in the world just vanished, except for him and Carly, he wouldn’t care as long as he had Carly. And the same with her.</p><p>He’s already demonstrated that he will choose Carly over anybody, even his own children.</p><p>She lost her half of the hotel. An investment that was probably worth several million dollars; triple digit.</p><p>Nina bought it and was going to give it to Carly but Carly refused. It doesn’t matter what Nina’s motive was, it was an offer that was extended and refused.</p><p>Michael and Sonny offered to buy it back for her or loan her the money but she refused.</p><p>Jason shows up and hands her a set of keys and says “I bought the hotel for you” and she just accepts it like he was giving her a pack of gum. Like it’s perfectly normal for people to give her a several hundred million dollar gift.</p><p>Whatever their relationship is, it’s sick and I don’t mean “sick” in a good way. It’s beyond obsession. It’s a mania or compulsion.<br>.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Yep they both knew. The kicker with Sam is in 2020 she banned Jason from Danny’s life after the explosion at the Floating Rib basically if you love us , stay away. Jason returns… Sam has repeated told Jason to stay away from Danny. Now that she knows Jason did all of this for Carly and she’s furious.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Thank you. I thought I was alone with this. Their relationship has actually gotten more dysfunctional IMO.</p><p>All they do is look at each other with their boo boo eyes & talk about how they have to protect one another, how it doesn’t matter what the other one does (murder, mayhem) & they trust that each other did it for the RIGHT REASONS & assuring each other that anything wrong they ever did that their heart was in the right place & it really was someone else’s fault anyway…& sometimes we will have Carly shrieking to Jason about how everyone misunderstands him but her & mistreats him (the most coddled character ever) as he pleads with her to calm down. It’s all so juvenile.</p><p>They need to be together though because any other potential love interest for either of them deserves better.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Like Carly was furious when her children grieved for a father that wasn’t dead?</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Difference is Carly wasn’t banning Sonny from their children’s lives before he went missing, they were married and had a fairly happy life. That’s not true for Jason and Sam. Sam told Jason to stay away from his son, if you love us, let us go and since his return she’s done nothing but forbid the two of them from seeing each other. Now she’s furious and instead of confronting Jason, she goes off on Carly, who didn’t even know about the recording. Sam can’t have it both ways, either she wants Jason or doesn’t but she needs to make up her mind.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I don’t agree with the banning. I rewatch JaSam scenes fairly regularly & Sam told him she would not keep Danny from him when she broke up with him. She made the adult choice to not add to the danger by sharing that life with him. Their break up was extremely amicable.</p><p>But in the end, it is not at all relevant to me. There is no satisfactory reason to let your young children believe you’re dead. I certainly wouldn’t find any satisfactory reason if it happened to my children. It doesn’t matter how much time he spent with them or how much access he had. THERE IS NO EXCUSE…at least not the dumb excuse he’s got.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>What Jason needs to do is to prove himself as a decent father who will give up his criminal life for his children’s sake. That’s the only thing he needs to do.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvJmqqopl2jsqaw0marqGWjqrJuv8CmZJ%2BnomKwtr%2FTqJuyZ2hnhnWBlA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jenna-bush-hager-s-daughter-confirms-mom-never-wears-underwear-video-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenna Bush Hagers Daughter Confirms Mom Never Wears Underwear: Video  Hollywood Life">&larr;
