The actor popped the question to his now fiancée, Addie Hall, in March 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here is a look into their love life, when things started between the two, and if Sussman is planning to make her his new wife anytime soon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Kevin Sussman Got Engaged to Girlfriend Addie Elizabeth Hall</h2><p>On March 29, 2022, Sussman surprised everyone on the internet with an engagement announcement as he uploaded a picture with his now fiancée, Hall, on both Instagram and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>"Folks... she said yes!" the caption of the posts read as he attached a picture of them at a restaurant named Pastis somewhere. She had her left hand over his shoulder, which gave everyone a clear view of her now-ringed finger.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The couple looked elated&nbsp;as they posed for the camera. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Sussman's engagement announcement post with his soon-to-be wife, Addie Elizabeth Hall.</strong> (Photo: Kevin Sussman/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Both his Instagram and Twitter posts were soon flooded with congratulatory messages for Sussman and Hall. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His on-screen partners Lauren Lapkus and Brian O'Halloran were two of the many who gave their good wishes to the newly engaged couple.</p><h2>When Did Kevin Sussman Start Dating Addie Elizabeth Hall?</h2><p>There's no exact date on that available yet as the couple has not revealed much about their relationship. However, they had become comfortable enough with each other and their romance by October 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Sussman made his dating life with Hall <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram official</a> through a post on October 19, 2020. By the looks of the picture and the caption, the couple probably went pumpkin hunting shortly before the upload. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Since then, the actor has been posting about Hall fairly often in between posts about his dogs, sketches on his iPad, and work-related stuff. They celebrate holidays together and co-parent his furry kids.</p><p>In most of his posts, he makes jokes about his relationship and how great a time he is having.</p><p>"Had so much fun on the east coast (normally I don't like fun but it was unavoidable," Sussman captioned one of his Instagram posts with her from July 10, 2021, posting a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lovely picture</a> of the two in the first slide, and a video of him dancing to a metal tune in the second. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>On <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Valentine's Day 2022</a>, instead of uploading a picture with his then girlfriend, he uploaded one where he and his dog were seen sleeping on his bed. This was the setup of the joke.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The punchline came on February 20 as he put up a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">selfie with Hall</a> and wrote, "This is to prove to Addie’s mom that we’re still together. (My Valentine’s Day post had her concerned)."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Sussman and Hall made their red carpet debut on February 24, 2022, as they attended the premiere of The Dropout, and called her a "gorgeous creature" in a subsequent post about the same. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Kevin Sussman’s Dating Life before Addie Elizabeth Hall</h2><p>Before Sussman started dating Hall, he was in a relationship with Whitney Rice. They dated for <a href=# rel="follow noopener">much of 2018</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Sussman with his ex girlfriend, Whitney Rice.</strong> (Photo: Kevin Sussman/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>2018 was also the year The Big Bang Theory&nbsp;star finally ended his marriage with Alessandra Young. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He reportedly married Young in January 2006 and separated on New Year's Eve in 2012. They lived that way for over six years, when finally, in October 2017, they signed their divorce papers.</p><p>The actor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">settled things</a> with Young with a one-time payment instead of endless&nbsp;spousal support. The payment was done when they first separated and not when the divorce became official in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOVq7avedKuqqylkaN6uLXFnmWhrJ2h</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tatcha-founder-vicky-tsai-on-giving-back-her-favorite-products.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tatcha Founder Vicky Tsai on Giving Back &amp;amp; Her Favorite Products">&larr;
