In 2008 Interview, West said-</p><p>Elvis was always different. We had crew cuts and wore T-shirts and blue jeans; Elvis had the long ducktail, the long sideburns, and he wore the loud clothes and naturally was a target for all the bullies. One day luckily I walked into the boys’ bathroom at Humes High School and three guys were going to cut his hair just, you know, to make themselves look big or make them feel big or whatever, and I intervened and stopped it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Elvis-Presley-Red-West.jpg><p><strong>Photo Credit:&nbsp;Pinterest</strong></p><p>West co-wrote several of Presley’s song, including “If You Talk in Your Sleep,” “You’ll Be Gone,” and “That’s Someone You Never Forget.” West also worked with several singers: Ricky Nelson, Pat Boone, and Johny Rivers.</p><p><strong>Also, Read:&nbsp;<a title="Colin Sylvia Wiki: Know How He Died And Explore His Partner, Son, Family, Height, And Parents" href=# rel="bookmark noopener">Colin Sylvia Died</a></strong></p><p>West was most famous for his role in the 1989 cult classic “Road House.” The first lead role of West’s career is in the drama “Goodbye Solo (2008), which labeled Roger Ebert “a masterwork” and The New York Times called “a near perfect film.”</p><p>In his interview in 2009 with The Commercial Appeal, West told-</p><p>It took me 59 years to be an overnight success.</p><p>And, further added:</p><p>&nbsp;I started out in this business as a stuntman, and it’s taken its toll&nbsp;on me.</p><p>Red West and his wife, Pat, celebrated their 56th wedding anniversary together on July 1.
