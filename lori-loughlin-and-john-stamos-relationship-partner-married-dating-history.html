While their characters were romantically involved on the show, in real life, they remained close friends. John Stamos, in his 2023 memoir, revealed the depth of their off-screen bond, acknowledging it was on the verge of turning romantic at one point. Despite their separate romantic journeys—Loughlin with Mossimo Giannulli and Stamos with Rebecca Romijn—their friendship endured through the years. The two actors have publicly supported each other, even during challenging times such as Loughlin’s involvement in the college admissions scandal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lori-Loughlin-and-John-Stamos-Relationship-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lori_Loughlin></span><strong>Who Is Lori Loughlin?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lori Anne Loughlin, an American actress, gained fame for her role as Rebecca Donaldson Katsopolis on the popular ABC sitcom “Full House” (1988-1995).

Beyond her “Full House” success, Loughlin showcased her talent in soap operas, including “The Edge of Night” (1980-1983), and series like “90210” (2008-2012) and “When Calls the Heart” (2014-2019).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lori-loughlin-1-0a23282a2ebc49038d4e6b568487fcdc-1024x683.jpg><p>In 2019, Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, faced legal troubles in the college admissions bribery scandal.
