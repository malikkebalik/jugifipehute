If you didn't know, then let us tell you Paula is Vinny's mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Paula is an Italian lady who is from Sicily, Italy. The charming lady has been seen multiple times on <i>Jersey Shore</i> with Vinny & the gang. As Vinny's mama, she used to come in to cook for him and does the laundry. But all that is perfectly normal for Vinny is a family-oriented guy who lives with his family.</p><h2>Net Worth: How Rich Is Paula's Son Vinny Guadagnino?</h2><p>Paula Guadagnino's son Vinny is one of the richest reality TV stars out there. He did buy the family a house in Staten Island in 2012. He has gone on to make more real estate moves after this major purchase, buying and selling houses all over the area.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/7/Paula%20Guadagnino%20(1)-1670402944414.jpg><p>Vinny was paid about $75,000 per episode on the show and is worth about <strong>$2 million</strong>. As an original member of <i>Jersey shore</i>, Vinny makes the big bucks from the reboot J<i>ersey Shore: Family Vacation</i>. He also released a cookbook named <i>The Keto Guido Cookbook: Delicious Recipes to Get Healthy and Look Great</i>.</p><h2>How Was The Married Life Of &nbsp;Paula?</h2><p>Paula Giacomo got married relatively young to Mr. Guadagnino, a fellow Italian-origin man. The pair tried hard to pursue a better life for their three kids and lived in poor situations.</p><p>Sadly, her husband turned out to be an absent father. This is reported to be one of the reasons they separated. While the couple lives in the same house, they live on different floors. Reportedly, they are still legally married and do not choose to divorce due to religious reasons.</p><p>Paula's husband has been very private and has not made any appearances on his son Vinny's reality TV projects or on Instagram. In interviews, Vinny Guadagnino stated that his father, while living in the same house, was never interested in doing projects together.</p><h2>About Paula's Brother, Uncle Nino</h2><p>Uncle Nino was also a recurring member of <i>Jersey Shore</i>. He was also well-liked by the audience. His real name is &nbsp;Antonio Giaimo. He is the brother of Paula Guadagnino. He has been an active part in raising her kids and is like a father figure to them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/6/zimbio%20(1)-1670311173932.jpg><p>Uncle Nino has collaborated with his sister and nephew in various projects and is an active part of their on-screen family unit.

He is also active on Cameo.</p><h2>Is Paula Active On Social Media?</h2><p>Paula reportedly has an Instagram account called <a href=# rel=nofollow>@mammapaolag</a>, but sadly it is a private account. However, her account has over 31.6k followers. She had previously joined Twitter in 2013, but that account is no longer active.&nbsp;</p><p>Vinny, on the other hand, is a famous social media personality mostly due to his career as a reality TV Star. His Instagram handle, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@vinnyguadagnino</a>, has 4.2 million followers.&nbsp;</p><p>Vinny is also active on Twitter and has an account under the username <a href=# rel=nofollow>@VINNYGUADAGNINO</a> and has 2.7 million followers, and so does his Facebook page, Vinny Guadagnino.&nbsp;</p><h2>Has Three Children</h2><p>Paula is the mother of three children.

Born Vincent J. Guadagnino on November 11, 1987, the Italian-American boy has made it big.&nbsp;</p><p>He has worked as an actor and writer, but his claim to fame is the reality TV series <i>Jersey Shore</i> and the reboot <i>Jersey Shore Family Vacation</i>. Recently he competed in season 31 of <i>Dancing with the Stars</i> with Koko Iwasaki as his partner. This is similar to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Celia Pacquola</a>'s experience in the show.</p><p>But sadly, he was eliminated early on and is actually being romantically linked with another star on the same show, Gabby Windey.</p><h2>Paula Bonding With Her Son Vinny</h2><p>When Vinny was on the <i>Jersey Shore,</i> he brought his mother, Paula, and uncle Nino to the show. Since then, they have been fixtures in his TV career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/6/Screenshot%202022-12-06%20125338-1670310572512.jpg><p>Paula was a part of Vinny's projects from the very start.
