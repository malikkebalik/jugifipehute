Kristen is a hypnotherapist and a paranormal investigator who has been fascinated by the mysteries of the human mind and the supernatural world since her childhood. She has pursued her passion for psychology and paranormal research through her education, career, and media appearances. In this article, we will introduce you to Kristen Luman, the ghost hunter who uses her skills and knowledge to help people understand and cope with their paranormal experiences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Fact</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=11><tr><td>Full name</td><td>Kristen P.

For the most part, she focused her studies on Paranormal Psychology and Human Development. During her college years, Kristen while preparing to go on to graduate school was introduced to hypnotherapy. Recalling her early years, Kristen revealed,</p><p>‘I should look into this, if I’m going to help people, I should learn all the possible tools. I met with a hypnotherapist myself and was astounded by the simplicity and the effectiveness of the process.’</p><p>Since her early encounter with the hypnosis, Kristen is obsessed with unlocking the power of the mind.</p><p>‘I decided after only one visit that this is what I should be doing if I truly wanted to make a positive difference in people’s lives. We use about 88% of our subconscious mind compared to 12% of our conscious mind. So, it made more sense to me that since hypnotherapy works directly with the subconscious mind this is how I should be helping people.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life after college</h2><p>Following her graduating, Kristen enrolled at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute and became a certified hypnotherapist. A part American Hypnosis Association, Kristen also received certifications in Pain Management and Energy Healing. She also holds a diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy with Honors from the Hypnosis Motivation Institute. She is also a Certified Specialist in Hypnotherapy and Weight Loss and also has Advanced Training in NLP. Even though Kirsten recognized for her skills, the reality star has never stopped learning. She continued her education with the American Hypnosis Education and received certifications in Advanced Child Hypnosis, Hypnosis in History, and is also a Therapeutic Imagery Facilitator. Kristen also conducts regular classes in Guided Imagery Meditation at Unplug Meditation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kristen-Luman-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reality TV</h2><p>Kristen’s first-ever appearance in reality TV came in 2013 when she starred in Ghost Mine. The series featured the happenings of the Crescent Mine which is believed to be haunted. A group of miners and ghost hunters dived deep within the mine to search for gold while also busting some ghosts. Unfortunately, the series was canceled after two seasons. Kristen bowed out from the reality TV scene after the show’s end, only to come back with Ghost Hunters. The co-lead investigator and a paranormal researcher on the team, Kristen has used her knowledge of parapsychology in investigating over 100 cases. Tasked with dealing with the witness, Kristen uses several techniques from her arsenal to calm the witness and get to the bottom of the sightings.</p><p>In addition to being a TV personality, Kristen also has a website that showcases her skills and services as a hypnotherapist. Her website is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">kristenluman.com</a>. Her website is designed to be user-friendly and professional, with a simple and elegant layout. The navigation bar allows the visitors to access different sections of the website, such as About, Videos, Testimonials, Shop, and Contact. The About section introduces Kristen Luman as a certified hypnotherapist and a member of the American Hypnosis Association. It also describes her academic background in psychology and paranormal psychology, as well as her affiliations with various organizations and institutions. The Videos section showcases some of her videos related to hypnosis. The Testimonials section features positive feedback from her clients who have benefited from her hypnosis services. The Shop section allows the visitors to purchase hypnosis downloads for different purposes, such as sleep, happiness, motivation, weight loss, etc. The Contact section provides the visitors with an online form to send inquiries or requests to Kristen Luman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are some of the TV shows that Kristen Luman has been on except Ghost Mine and Ghost Haunters?</h2><p>Besides Ghost Mine and Ghost Hunters, some of the TV shows that Kristen has been on are:</p><ul><li>Spiral (2007): A short film that starred Kristen as a woman who experiences strange events after moving into a new apartment.</li><li>Harvest of Fear (2004): A movie that featured Kristen as a reporter who investigates a series of murders linked to a mysterious cult.</li><li>Drama Queens (2009): A comedy series that had Kristen as one of the cast members who played exaggerated versions of themselves.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Kristen’s net worth is estimated to be around $1 million. She earns her income from her hypnotherapy practice, her TV appearances, her seminars and classes, and her online products such as hypnosis downloads and guided meditations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life: Husband and Kids</h2><p>Even though a popular TV actor, media houses are yet to break grounds on Kristen Luman’s personal life. In the hope revealing about her affairs and relationship, a scroll through her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram profile</a> does not give much besides the facts she is godmother to her nephew. As of now, we can not say whether or not Kristen is a married woman. Kristen does not have any children yet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Controversy</h2><p>Kristen is rumored to be dating her Ghost Mine co-star Patrick Doyle, who is also a paranormal investigator and a tech expert.
