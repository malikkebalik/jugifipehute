The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>retired wrestling star</a>, née&nbsp;<strong>Terry Eugene</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bollea</strong>, confirmed the news on<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Twitter</a> on February 28, 2022, after fans began to inquire about Sky suddenly appearing in his social media posts. “Yo Maniacs just for the record,the Facebook and Instagram posts are of me and my girlfriend Sky,I am officially divorced, sorry I thought everyone already knew,love my Maniacs4Life,” he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> in a tweet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Then, in July 2023, Hulk confirmed he asked for Sky’s hand in marriage in July 2023 — and she said, “Yes!” He revealed that he popped the question while they were having dinner in a Tampa, Fla, restaurant, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. The lovebirds then said “I do” during a “low key” wedding on September 22, 2023, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a> reported. Of course, Hulk has been married twice before. Here’s everything to know about Sky, Jennifer, and Hulk’s first wife, <strong>Linda Hogan</strong>, and their romances with him.</p><h2>Sky Daily</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Sky-Daily-5-Things-BG-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s not clear exactly when Sky started dating Hulk, but they were first seen in public together at a <strong>Bret Michaels</strong> concert on February 26, 2022. He took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share a video of him and the blonde beauty meeting with Bret backstage, which can be seen below, and at one point he introduced her to the singer as “my girl.” After fans started speculating, he tweeted his confirmation of his divorce from Jennifer and his new relationship with Sky.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite the confirmation, Sky has remained pretty private throughout her romance with Hulk. Her social media accounts are all set to private and she’s only appeared in a handful of posts on Hulk’s own accounts. She has reportedly listed her occupation as an “accountant” and “yoga instructor” in her social media bio at one point, and is apparently a mother of three.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sky and Hulk <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were photographed</a> attending a friend’s birthday party on February 25, 2023 and showed off PDA by putting their arms around each other. The outing happened shortly after it was reported that Hulk had back surgery. Their engagement happened in July 2023 and they reportedly exchanged vows in Clearwater, FL in front of guests that sadly didn’t include Hulk’s daughter, <strong>Brooke</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“It was a low key wedding. Neither of them wanted over the top, just a small affair with their nearest and dearest to declare their deep love and commitment to each other. Sadly Brooke did not show up,” a source told the outlet</p><h2>Jennifer McDaniel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hulk-hogan-with-wife-jennifer-mcdaniel-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Jennifer McDaniel</strong>, born on May 13, 1974, was Hulk’s second wife. Hulk met Jennifer, a former makeup artist, in 2008 after his divorce from Linda and the pair got engaged soon thereafter. Jennifer was a prominent makeup artist in Hollywood and was even nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Make-Up Artist for the movie Let Me In. The couple ultimately walked down the aisle on December 28, 2010 in a private, intimate ceremony in the backyard of their Clearwater, Fla. home. They do not have any children together, and kept their relationship out of the limelight. Jennifer did, however, make several appearances on Hulk’s Instagram page for vacations, shopping trips, and the like.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Although many were skeptical about their relationship due to Jennifer being about 20 years Hulk’s junior, they managed to stay together even through difficult trials, such as Hulk’s sex scandal with <strong>Heather Clem</strong>, his friend’s wife, which saw their sex tape released by media outlet Gawker. The incident lead to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a lengthy lawsuit</a> that ultimately led to the company going bankrupt.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>It wasn’t until February 28, 2022 that Hulk shared <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the finality of his separation</a> from Jennifer via his Twitter account. He didn’t release any further explanation of their split.</p><h2>Linda Hogan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hulk-hogan-with-ex-wife-linda-ss-embed11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Linda Hogan&nbsp;</strong>was Hulk’s first wife and they were together for over 24 years. Linda was born Linda Marie Claridge on August 24, 1959 in Los Angeles, Calif. She and Hulk met at a restaurant in LA in the early ’80s and maintained a long-distance relationship for two years over the phone. They tied the knot in 1983 and their wedding was attended by numerous other professional wrestlers at the time, like <strong>Andre the Giant</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Vince McMahon</strong>, and more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Although Linda sang backup vocals in the Hulk’s Wrestling Boot Band in the ’90s, she didn’t truly rise to fame until 2005 when she and the Hogan kids, Brooke, born in 1988, and <strong>Nick</strong>, born in 1990, joined Hulk for the VH1 reality show Hogan Knows Best, which documented their lives. Linda ultimately filed for divorce in 2007 and their divorce was finalized in 2009, after which Linda released a memoir&nbsp;Wrestling the Hulk: My Life Against the Ropes. The book detailed elements of her marriage and Hulk’s violent past. In the 2011 memoir, Linda shared some harrowing details of her time with the former pro-wrestler.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“[Hulk] tore my shirt. He threw lamps. He held me down on the bed with his hands around my throat during arguments, slamming doors, pounding walls,” she wrote, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. “I was always afraid he would kill me in one of his rages.” In addition to the memoir, Linda’s publicist told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News </a>in 2008 that Linda filed for divorce because of Hulk’s affair with&nbsp;<strong>Christiane Plante</strong>, which was their daughter, Brooke’s, close friend. Although Hulk’s publicist claimed Linda was making the accusation for “attention,” Christiane later confirmed the relationship to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>National Enquirer</a>&nbsp;in 2008, alleging that she and the Hulk’s relationship started when he and Linda “privately” knew their marriage was ending.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>After her divorce, Linda made headlines by dating a much younger man,&nbsp;<strong>Charley Hill&nbsp;</strong>(he was 19, and she was 48 when they started dating in 2008). Although he proposed in 2021 during an episode of Couple’s Therapy on VH1, the two never married and he ended up <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filing a $1.5 million lawsuit in 2014</a> for chores he performed, including waxing her yacht, fertilizing 25 acres of avocado trees, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8euo6RlmKS0orqMsKCfnV1pg3d9kGlvaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bruce Willis 'stepping away' from acting due to aphasia">&larr;
