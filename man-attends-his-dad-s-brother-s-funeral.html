However, his grandfather revealed the true identity of his biological dad when his uncle, Jon, passed away. The revelation made Damian realize many things in his life and the concept of family.</p><p class=Zg>Like many families, Damian Delune's life is filled with family secrets and unexpected revelations. However, his story is a testament to the power of love and connection, regardless of blood ties.</p><p class=Zg>Born in North Carolina, Damian grew up knowing his father was Frank. At that time, Frank was not his mother's legal spouse. She was married to his brother, Jon, her estranged husband, who was also the man on Jon's birth certificate.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A man kissing a baby on the forehead. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>However, Damian's mother explained that Jon's name was only written on the document because of legal complexities. Back then, a woman's lawful husband was supposed to be etched on her child's birth certificate, regardless of the birth father.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A father with a baby on his lap while driving. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Damian believed this lie for many years. He saw Frank as his dad and, later, Charles, his stepfather, both of whom were abusive. Although genuine paternal love was absent in his formative years, Damian found a father figure in Jon.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A man and a young boy looking at each other. | Source: Shutterstock</p><p class=Zg>He spent much time with Jon growing up, feeling no different in treatment from Jon's other biological kids. However, he saw Jon as nothing more than a kind uncle.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A man lifting a child in the air. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Years later, when Jon passed away, Damian returned to North Carolina for the funeral. He was greeted by a drunk grandfather, who revealed a long-time secret. It turned out that Jon was Damian's biological father. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://damiandelune.medium.com/7-years-ago-i-both-lost-my-dad-and-found-out-who-he-really-was-7235aa1ac860>said</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"I was never told the truth until the day Jon died — my grandfather got a little too drunk the night of his wake and told me the truth."</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A tombstone with flowers. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>The revelation sparked many thoughts in Jon's head. It left him wondering what could have been of his life had he known the truth from the beginning. Nevertheless, Damian was grateful to have spent a lot of time with Jon, who treated him with unwavering kindness and affection.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A wooden casket. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>As a parent, Damian realized that family is not confined to bloodlines but is defined by those who show love, care, support, and affection. Despite knowing Jon as only an uncle, he felt what a family was like in Jon's presence.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A man thinking in the dark. | Source: Shutterstock</p><p class=Zg>Jon knew Damian was his son all along but kept this knowledge to himself. He could have easily distanced himself from Damian, forfeiting his rights as a father, but instead, he watched from the sidelines. Damian <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.yourtango.com/family/attended-uncle-funeral-found-out-father>said</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"I had no idea Jon was my bio dad until after he was gone. Sure, I knew he was biologically related to me, but that didn't even matter. He wasn't under any real obligation even then to spend time with me — not legally anyway."</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A man thinking in the dark. | Source: Shutterstock</p><p class=Zg>This realization allowed Damian to understand the true meaning of family, placing importance on the people who treat you well when it matters most.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>An elderly man hugging a boy. | Source: Shutterstock</p><p class=Zg>Now married, Jon and his wife have lost connection to their blood relatives. However, besides their children, they have come to know many people as family.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A family having dinner. | Source: Shutterstock</p><p class=Zg>"We're lucky enough that we've finally found a family on our own who cares about us and wants to be a part of our lives. They support us through the good and the bad, the way family should," he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.yourtango.com/family/attended-uncle-funeral-found-out-father>said</a>.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A father and his two boys. | Source: Shutterstock</p><p class=Zg>Damian felt a bit sad that it took Jon's death to learn who his biological father was. However, he also considered the gravity of the situation on his grandfather, who spent years burdened by his children's secrets.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A young boy smiling outdoors. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>According to Damian, his grandfather spent years guilty about how his kids turned out and probably didn't enjoy life to the fullest because of them. " I won't allow my family or anyone else to dictate the terms of my happiness," Damian <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.yourtango.com/family/attended-uncle-funeral-found-out-father>added</a>.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A boy hugging a man in the hospital. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Do you think you would feel regretful if you were Damian? What would you have done in this situation?</p><p class=Zg>In a similar <a class="zd d" href=#>story</a>, a woman felt betrayed when she learned her husband had been deceiving her for many years. After encouraging her to care for a young boy whom she treated as her own, she later discovered her husband was the father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1oa2xgZ3qurc1mmK2slaOxtHnHoqpmnJGZwG6u0airoZ2iqHqnwc2eqZqkXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./travis-bacon-bio-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Bacon  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
