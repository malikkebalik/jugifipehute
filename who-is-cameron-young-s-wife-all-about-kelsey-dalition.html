Young attended Wake Forest University and became a professional golfer in 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after going pro, Young married Dalition at 23 years old. At the same time, Young’s professional career was booming. He made his Korn Ferry Tour debut in July 2020 and won his first professional tournament at the AdventHealth Championship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, Young was named the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year and made his Tour Championship and U.S. Presidents Cup team debuts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a second-place finish at the SGC-Dell Match Play tournament, Young played in his second <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Masters</a> in April 2023.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve been playing well. I feel like the result in Austin, I think, was more reflective of it than a lot of them before that, kind of early this season. But I feel like it’s been going the right direction, and [I’m] just excited to get the week started,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TenGolf</a> in April 2023.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Young grows in his career, he has had his family beside him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who is Cameron Young’s wife?

The two became close while attending school at Wake Forest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">McKean started caddying for Young in August 2020 when Young needed someone for the Albertson Boise Tournament, and after a few gigs, McKean joined Young’s side full-time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Young needed McKean for a three-week run in September 2020, McKean fully committed. “He called me back an hour and a half later and had quit his job,” Young told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Golf Monthly</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He’s giving up a lot to be away from home a lot, and not necessarily get to play golf, do other things he likes to do, but we have a great time,” Young said. “We have a lot of fun. It makes the travel and the long days a lot easier.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-shares-one-child-with-young></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She shares one child with Young</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dalition and Young share one child, a son named Henry. Young said his son has helped him “forget about golf” a bit when he gets off the course and enjoy more family time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have spent a lot of time with my family, my wife. We have a little baby, so spent a lot of family time, which has been great,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Golf Digest</a>. “Honestly, they've been out with me the last couple weeks and it's been such a nice change of pace to be with them on the road.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, “I think it just keeps you a little fresher. You get off the course and you can kind of forget about golf a little bit, which is really nice."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-live-in-jupiter-florida></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They live in Jupiter, Florida</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair were living at Young’s parents’ house when they welcomed Henry. Young shared that while he was finding success as a professional golfer, the couple had yet to move into their own house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We've been living with our parents the whole time," Young told Golf Digest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2022, Young said he couldn’t yet afford a home in Jupiter, Florida, where many professional golfers live. However, in the following months, Young and Dalition were able to make the move.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We said 'that's enough, we're gonna buy something,’ " he said in March 2022.

It wasn't like ... I don't think I looked terrible. I don't know,” Young said at Oak Hill Country Club, where he was preparing for the competition, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Golf Digest</a>. “Yeah, I haven't been clean-shaven probably since our first son was born.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6edvG610mainqSjmsZusMCloK2hn6N6pK3Mnqmopl2uvLa6xmauop6VYoR2fI9qam4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-keenan-cooks-from-dance-100.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Keenan Cooks From Dance 100?">&larr;
