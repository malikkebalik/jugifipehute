I’ve been eating an Olsen twin diet for six weeks so chances are I weigh a bit less than what I did when I went in but it is not about weight loss for me at all.”</p><p>Swan’s fellow celebrities lost substantial amounts of weight during their time in the camp.</p><p>Merv Hughes shed a whopping 17kgs, while series winner <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=story-fni0cjvj-1227263758362 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff </a>dropped 10kgs and <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=story-fn8yvfst-1227264239217 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>Barry Hall </a>lost 13kgs.</p><p>“I feel really strong,” she said. “I have been more active in the last six weeks than I have been probably in my whole life, exercising and trusting my body more to do stuff and giving it a go and I’ve been surprised with how much I can do.”</p><p>AFL great Hall has offered to help Swan with a fitness program when they return to Melbourne.</p><p>“We live quite close to each other and he is going to take me through some strength things,” she said. “He is going to sort me out with a strength program. I won’t see body building championships but you never know.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Swan responded to criticism from one freelance celebrity commentator provocatively questioned her motivations for going on the show, accusing her of leaving her three children at home.</p><p>“In our case, I’m the bread winner,” she said. “That’s how our family works and we are as happy as clams. No one needs to worry about us. And if you do feel the desperate desire to worry about someone else’s children, please visit care.org.au there are billions of children that really do require your concern, mine aren’t those.”</p><p>Having her husband, Chris Saville, and six-year-old son, Leo, visit her in the camp was the highlight of the series for Swan.</p><p>“Words can’t describe that and I’m really glad through everything I did, Leo got something tangible out of it as well,” she said.</p><p>Looking ahead, Swan is open to whatever career opportunities come her way but says she will be spending the next few weeks with her family.</p><p>“I feel so fortunate,” she said. “It is not lost on me. To work in TV and radio is like a gift, it is the most fun you can have and to even be in a position to be thinking about more stuff like that, I feel really fortunate. In terms of what I can see happening, right now I want to spend a few weeks with my kids and I’ll see what happens.”</p><p>Swan’s take on her fellow campmates throughout the series —</p><p><b>Barry Hall</b></p><p>Beautiful, beautiful man. He’s gentle but no nonsense. Zero tolerance of fluff. He and I got along because I don’t do fluff either.</p><p><b>Freddie Flintoff</b></p><p>Complicated, intelligent, incredibly wise. Freddie helped me in ways that I could never have predicted. He is a very special man. I was really surprised by Freddie.</p><p><b>Merv Hughes</b></p><p>Merv when you meet him is really scary. He is a big man and he’s gruff and he says bizarre things given it is 2015. You stay with him and he is the gentlest, sweetest man that you could ever hope to meet.</p><p><b>Andrew Daddo</b></p><p>Low-key, suspicious, intuitive.</p><p><b>Maureen McCormick</b></p><p>My spirit animal. Magical. Crazy. The fact that I was living in the jungle with Marcia Brady never got old.</p><p><b>Leisel Jones</b></p><p>I feel sad for her because I think she left before she could get anything out of it and I think probably she was pumped the most for it and got the least.</p><p><b>Joel Creasey</b></p><p>Soulmate. Where would I have been without him. It is very rare that a connection like that happens. I feel like we are related.</p><p><b>Tyson Mayr</b></p><p>Looks like a crustacean. It is like when you turn over a cockroach, it is an abdomen thorax. He is so nice that I sometimes found it hard to talk to him because the people that I know are generally ratbags and there’s not one ratbag around Tyson. I still don’t know how he earns money. I have got no idea what he does for a living and I’ve been living in the jungle with him for six weeks.</p><p><b>Julie Goodwin</b></p><p>Feisty and loyal. There’s just not a bad bone in her body.</p><p><b>Lauren Brant</b></p><p>I’m a fan of Lauren, I know that she polarised everyone in camp. Initially she drove me crazy but once you understood her, she was hilarious. So bossy, so much energy, she’s like Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. When someone gets that fit, everyone annoys them.</p><p><b>Laura Dundovic</b></p><p>Dundo surprised me. I thought that she was going to be a vacuous person but she was actually really meaty and funny and she doesn’t take shit from anyone. She surprised me a lot, I really loved Laura.</p><p><b>Tim Robards</b></p><p>Another crustacean. I will be honest with you, people that massage other people make me nervous in the same way as when you go to a stand-up gig and you get the vibe that you will be pulled out. I just circled him because I can’t stand massages.</p><p><b>Anna Heinrich</b></p><p>Anna did a lot better without Tim. When they were in together, they may as well have not been there; they just hung out together and were two extra mouths to feed. When he left, she came into her own. She’s probably another one of those so nice that there wasn’t too much to grab on to because there was no ratbag element.</p><p>— The journalist is in South Africa as a guest of Channel Ten.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e9OvZqudkaG2tcWMra1om5intrS%2FyJ5krK%2BRo3qlu8Sspa1lp5a7tXnTqGSkpp%2Bseqm71makrpuYYsSmtcahq2armJp6rbvSrWSipl2ptaZ5ya6loKSVZLumw9Jmqq2noq58d33Bbmyfb2ZpsnOvlXJonmuTl4Cmf5Bsm3CcZWewp4Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./julian-lennon-net-worth-archives.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="julian lennon net worth Archives">&larr;
