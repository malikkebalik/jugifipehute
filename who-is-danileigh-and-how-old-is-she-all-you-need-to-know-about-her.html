What do we know about her, though?</p><p>Here is all the information you need to know about DaniLeigh, including her age, net worth, songs, and the Instagram handle.</p><h2>Are DaniLeigh and DaBaby in a relationship?</h2><p>After breaking up with her lover, DaBaby, in February 2021, DaniLeigh stated that she is now a single woman. She accompanied the “Officially single” words on Instagram with a black heart emoji.</p><p>With a sweet photo of herself cuddling with the rapper in December 2020, the singer officially acknowledged their long-rumored affair.</p><p>She first revealed to fans that the two were dating when she captioned the picture, “My baby IDC.” During the same weekend, Dani also appeared on DaBaby’s Instagram story.</p><p>On his song “Go,” from the deluxe edition of his album Blame It On Baby, DaBaby seems to confirm his connection with DaniLeigh.</p><p>He raps, “Ooh, did he say that? R&B fanatic, I try to f**k her every day/Curly-haired jiggy b***h, it might be DaniLeigh. Probably, you should play back.</p><p>Just days after the R&B singer made a hint that she might not be done with rappers, after all, the song was released. Dani has not yet responded to the rumors.</p><p>DaniLeigh posted a message on her Instagram Stories that read, “Before I land. I want to reassure myself that this is a reset vacation.” “God won’t permit anything that isn’t for me… What I love should reciprocate in kind. I entirely love myself, God, and my family.</p><p>She continued, “I finished everything I needed to. My movie is finished, and my press looks wild. My record cover is done. I’m seeking closure, emptying my mind, purging my soul, and returning home to a new person. I worked so hard even while I was being hurt.</p><p>Rapper DaBaby and actress DaniLeigh co-starred in the music video for their song collaboration “Levi High,” which fueled the initial dating rumors between them.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s been so fun getting to meet you guys on the 4 Velour Tour! 💞 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vSx80hqzIN</a></p><p>— Danielle 🤍 (@DaniLeigh) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 29, 2022</a></p><p>They first denied any romance rumors, but after their Instagram accounts indicated that they were staying in the same West Hollywood hotel during quarantine, they were again linked.</p><p>The couple’s experiences haven’t always been smooth, though.

For good measure, she also added a purple heart emoji.</p><p>A few days earlier, they were seen holding hands in West Hollywood, although neither has publicly acknowledged their relationship.</p><p>Even though the two broke up, there is speculation that DaBaby is the biological father of Danileigh’s pregnant kid.</p><p>When the celebrity “liked” her pregnancy announcement post in July 2021, rumors started circulating.</p><p>Then she tweeted a photo of herself holding her growing baby belly with the message “#dabiggest,” which admirers took to be a play on the rapper’s name.</p><p>The rumors haven’t been formally confirmed by either of the two.</p><h2>What is the Instagram for DaniLeigh?</h2><p>DaniLeigh frequently posts on Instagram, where she goes by the handle @iamdanileigh.</p><p>She shares selfies, behind-the-scenes photos from her photoshoots and music videos, dancing videos, as well as images from her daily life.</p><h2><strong>What’s DaniLeigh’s net worth?</strong></h2><p>DaniLeigh’s net worth is estimated to be approximately $400,000.</p><h2>What are the biggest songs by DaniLeigh?</h2><p>In 2017, DaniLeigh joined Def Jam Records and began releasing mixtapes and singles, working with artists including YG, Lil Baby, and Lil Yachty.</p><p>The Chris Brown-featuring remix of her song “Easy” is one of her most popular tracks to date.</p><p></p><h2 aria-hidden=true>FAQs</h2><h3>How old is DaniLeigh?</h3><p>DaniLeigh, who is she?
