As of now, in 2022, the Pussycat Dolls lead singer is 43 years old but she does not look her age. Her pictures of the past and now are definitely before and after pictures of plastic surgery. Nicole Scherzinger is believed to have gotten Botox, nose job, lip fillers and breast enlargement surgery.</strong></p><p><b>Nicole Prascovia Elikolani Valiente</b> known professionally as<b> Nicole Scherzinger</b> (born on June 29, 1978) is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>singer</strong></a>, songwriter, dancer, actress, and television personality who rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time in 2003. Her prominence in the group was a source of conflict within them, eventually leading to its dissolution in 2009. Despite her mainstream success, Scherzinger has struggled to carve out a successful solo career. She abandoned her first attempt with her debut EP, Her Name Is Nicole, and went on to release two moderately successful studio albums, Killer Love in 2011 and Big Fat Lie in 2014.</p><p>Nicole Scherzinger also appeared on television, winning Dancing with the Stars in 2010 and serving as a judge on The Sing-Off (2009–2010), The X Factor US (2011), four seasons of The X Factor UK (2012–2013, 2016–2017), and Australia's Got Talent (2019). Nicole made her West End debut in the 2014 revival of Cats, as well as appearances in the Disney animated film Moana (2016), the television film Dirty Dancing (2017), and the television special Annie Live! (2021).&nbsp;Scherzinger has sold over 16 million records as a solo artist and has received Grammy and Laurence Olivier Award nominations. She also has clothing lines and a fragrance, and she is an ambassador for the Special Olympics and a supporter of UNICEF UK.</p><p>Nicole Scherzinger has had a long career but still looks very young. She is in her 40s but she definitely does not look her age. People think her not aging is due to plastic surgery. So, what does Nicole Scherzinger have to say about the accusations of plastic surgery? Let's find out by reading this article!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>plastic surgery</a></strong> topics of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Lara Logan</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Melissa Rivers</a>.</strong></p><h2>Nicole Scherzinger's Plastic Surgery: Hints of Botox, Nose job, Lip fillers From Before and After Pictures!</h2><p>It is not uncommon for celebrities to rely on surgical procedures to look young and beautiful. Plastic surgery is currently a trend among celebrities. This has had an impact on people believing that even minor changes seen in celebrities lead to the conclusion that they have undergone surgical procedures to alter their appearance.</p><p>Such is the case of the American singer<strong> Nicole Scherzinger </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@nicolescherzinger</a>). Even though The Pussycat Dolls singer has denied having plastic surgery, one can hardly fail to notice that she is already in her 40s but she does not look her age. There is not much difference between her old and new photos in terms of age-wise looks. So, her fans have frequently speculated about her having undergone plastic surgery to retain her youthful appearance.</p><p>Nicole Scherzinger&nbsp;claims that the secret to her drastic transformation is drinking plenty of water and getting enough sleep, but is that enough and are we really supposed to believe that plastic surgery was not at play in her appearance? Her fans wonder if that is all there is to her age-defying looks.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Mirror</a>, a surgeon at MYA Cosmetic Surgery has revealed that Nicole Scherzinger has had a few tweaks done to alter her image and has listed out the plastic surgery procedures that she has had. She is believed to have had a boob job. When comparing her before and after pictures, her breasts definitely look fuller. It is assumed that Nicole may have requested a natural shape with more upper fullness whilst keeping in portion to her frame. According to surgical experts, a breast enlargement surgery would have cost between <strong>£5000</strong> and<strong> £6000</strong>.</p><p>The famous singer has also been linked to Botox. Botox, also known as wrinkle removal injection, is used to achieve smoother skin with no wrinkles. Nicole's skin is unquestionably smoother and wrinkle-free than that of other women her age. Nicole is also thought to have lip fillers. When comparing old and new photos of her, it is clear that her lips have plumped up. Nicole's lips appear natural and proportionate to her facial features, but they are definitely bigger than before so there is no doubt that she had lip filler injected.</p><p>Nicole's nose also might have been altered. Her fans have pointed out the differences between her previous and current photos. Her nose appears thinner and more defined. However, the singer, like many others, has denied having a rhinoplasty. Rhinoplasty procedures can range in price from <strong>£6000</strong> to <strong>£10,000</strong>.</p><p>There is no definitive proof that the singer underwent any plastic surgery, and all of the buzzes on <a href=# rel=noopener>social media</a> are based on rumors. If the Nicole Scherzinger had any surgical operations, her case is a perfect example of plastic surgery done correctly. Her face appears younger and smoother, but it retains enough realism to perplex her fans. The 43-year-old is currently trending on the Internet with the allegation of undergoing surgical operations to change her appearance. Nicole Scherzinger has stated,</p><p>"It’s about drinking a lot of water and getting a lot of sleep. It’s crazy what hot yoga or going on an amazing run will do. Anybody can get that stuff done, but for me, how I feel inside is a true reflection."</p><p>Though there are rumors flying around the Internet, with feeds and tweets flooded with news of Nicole Scherzinger undergoing plastic surgery, the singer has denied all of them. However, when comparing her photos, they are definitely before and after pictures of plastic surgery as it is clear that she has had multiple cosmetic surgery, if not to change her appearance, to not show her age.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGilopufobJuv8KhnKuymaO0pr6MqaOaq6SesG6%2F1KuenqqpZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./todd-deforest-poquoson-va-phs-football-coach-died-unexpectedly-phs-mourns.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Todd Deforest Poquoson VA, PHS Football Coach died unexpectedly, PHS mourns">&larr;
