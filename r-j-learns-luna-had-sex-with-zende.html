However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>At Forrester, Steffy tells Finn it’s insane that Deacon thinks Sheila is alive. She doesn’t care how many toes the body had; it was Sheila. “If anyone knows that, it should be me!” Steffy heard the paramedics call her time of death. Finn recaps that Deacon thinks he saw ten toes. Steffy says it’s impossible. He’s either lying or it’s wishful thinking. “It was definitely Sheila.” Steffy can’t believe Deacon is doing this. Finn reminds her the whole nightmare can be over. Steffy says it’s seared into her brain. Deacon needs to get a grip. She’s going to confront him. Once he can get it through his thick skull that Sheila’s dead, he’ll be better off. “We’ll all be better off.”</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Thomas returns with [Spoiler]?!</a></p><p>At Il Giardino, Deacon reads the messages from Sheila to Sugar, telling her to stay away from her. He pours himself a stiff drink and continues to study his laptop. “Maybe Finn’s right. Maybe I’m losing it.” He flashes to the scene in the crematorium. “Piggies in a blanket underneath the sheet. Sheila had nine toes, but I saw ten on those feet.” He decides, “Yeah, you’re definitely losing it,” and takes another drink. Deacon muses, “Why Sheila? Why did you go to Steffy’s that night? And who the hell is sugar?”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Deacon-BB-HW.jpg alt="Deacon B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the Forrester design office, Carter demands to know what exactly Zende and Luna did the night of Eric’s wedding. Zende confesses, “Luna and I slept together.” Zende explains that something happened to Luna tonight that explains why she was in his bed. Neither of them expected it to happen. He has feelings for her but never would have acted on them if he had known how much Luna loves RJ. Carter is confused. If she didn’t want this, and he didn’t want this, how did they end up sleeping together?!</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Heather Tom’s son is all grown up</a></p><p>Zende explains Poppy’s special mints getting mixed up with Luna’s regular mints. “Every time Luna thought she was taking a regular mint…” Carter interjects, “She was drugging herself and that’s why she thought she made love to RJ.” Zende knows how crazy it sounds. Carter asks if he’s sure it happened that way. Zende balks, “You think I’m lying to you?” Carter doesn’t. He knows the kind of man he is. Zende is upset about what happened, what Luna’s been through, and what RJ’s going to go through when he finds out what went down.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Carter-Zende-BB-HW.jpg alt="Carter Zende B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the beach house, Luna explains to RJ how she took Poppy’s special mints without knowing the night of Eric’s wedding. RJ asks her to tell him what happened to her that night. “Please!” Luna cries that if she has just stayed with him at Eric’s that night, none of this would be happening. She would give anything not to hurt him. The thought of betraying him kills her, but that’s exactly what happened. “I betrayed you that night.” Luna rants that the mints did something to her. She didn’t mean it! RJ asks her to calm down, she’s not making any sense. Luna says when she left the party, she was so tired and so thirsty… she happened to see water in one of the guesthouses, so she went inside to drink it. “I must have laid down in the bed because I was so exhausted.” RJ asks if that’s all she remembers. Luna says the next thing she remembers is RJ coming into the room and her saying she’d been waiting for him.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>How will B&B make *this* make sense?!</a></p><p>In the design office, Zende tells Carter that he can’t say anything about this to anyone. Carter won’t, but RJ deserves to know. Zende says Luna is telling him the whole story right now. “This has been tearing her apart. I just hope that RJ can understand.” Carter hates that this happened. Zende does too. Luna is a sweet person, who never would have cheated if not for her mother’s mints. Carter can only imagine the guilt Poppy is feeling. Zende thinks it was irresponsible and reckless. Carter asks what about him? Zende never would have done what he did had he known. It never occurred to him that Luna might have been on something. Carter asks, “What about taking accountability.” RJ is his cousin, which should have been enough for him to pump the brakes. Carter backs off. He doesn’t need a lecture from him. He just hates this for all of them. Zende worries that Luna’s world is about to blow sky-high. Carter muses, “You really do care about her, don’t you?”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Carter-Zende-2-BB-HW.jpg alt="Carter Zende B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the beach house, RJ recaps that Luan accidentally took her mother’s drugs and stumbled into one of the guesthouses. He asks whose it was. “I wasn’t there, but someone was, right?” Luna cries and nods. RJ demand, “Who was it?! Luna, answer me! I need to know!” Luna sobs, “It was Zende. I spent the night with Zende.” RJ reels. Luna rants that she had no idea she was with Zende. It wasn’t until the next morning that she realized what had happened. RJ asks her to stop. “My cousin… you two…” Luna is so sorry and reaches for RJ’s hands, “Please!” RJ pulls back.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RJ-Luna-BB-HW.jpg alt="RJ Luna B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Il Giardino, Deacon is still peering at Sheila and Sugar’s messages when Steffy and Finn walk in. He guesses Finn told Steffy what he said. Steffy doesn’t want to hear it. “You’re wrong. Dead wrong. I killed Sheila.” Deacon told her what she thinks happened… Steffy says she knows she killed Sheila, she saw her face. Deacon saw her too. He pulled back the sheet and it was definitely Sheila, but when the sheet slipped, he saw ten toes. “I definitely saw ten toes.” Finn says, “Deacon, you were emotional.” Deacon asks if they want him to just drop this. That’s exactly what Steffy wants him to do. Sheila got exactly what she deserved. “Now you need to stop this. You need to stop spreading these lies, OK? I don’t want to think about Sheila anymore, I don’t want to talk about her anymore. She is out of our lives forever. Do you hear me?! Forever.”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Steffy-Deacon-YR-CBS_be1fe2.jpg alt="Steffy Deacon B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>B&B gets it right… in the wrong way</a></p><p>Next on The Bold and the Beautiful: <a href=# rel=noopener>Hope tells Liam the real reason she turned down Thomas’ proposal</a>, and RJ angrily confronts Zende for sleeping with his girlfriend.</p><p><strong>Suspending disbelief!
