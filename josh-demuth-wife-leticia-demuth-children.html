Nevertheless, she had a significant role in his life because they were married for a long time and had kids together.</p><p>Leticia surely served as a source of strength and inspiration for Josh throughout his career as he overcame several obstacles.</p><p>She was there to share in his triumphs and comfort him in his losses. The relationship between Josh and Leticia remained solid and affectionate despite the challenges of being a professional athlete.</p><p>Josh Demuth’s appreciation for his family and his faith were evidence of his morals and principles.</p><h2><span id=Meet_the_Josh_Demuth_kids>Meet the Josh Demuth kids.</span></h2><p>Josh Demuth said in the interview that he had four kids.</p><p>By 2023, Devon, his oldest child, will be 22 years old. Sutton, his daughter, is 23 years old. Brody, his kid, is a 16-year-old. At the time of the interview, Bru was a toddler; by 2023, he would be around 9 years old.</p><p>Given his personal experiences and difficulties in the sport, was Josh Demuth willing to support his kids if they decided to pursue a career in racing?</p><p>Demuth stated that he would support his children’s desire to race, although he recognized the challenges involved.</p><p>He said he would not want to see his children go through the same difficulties, but he also mentioned that they had witnessed what he had gone through and knew what it meant to give up things and work hard to be successful in racing.</p><p>Demuth would support his children no matter what route they chose since, in the end, he thought it was what was best for them.</p><h2><span id=Josh_Demuth_Died_The_Cause_of_Death>Josh Demuth Died, The Cause of Death</span></h2><p>Tragically, Josh Demuth died, and the motocross community was rocked by the news of his passing.</p><p>His talent and commitment to the sport earned him a great deal of admiration and respect. Although Demuth’s particular cause of death has not been made public, sources indicate that he had a heart attack while spending time at home with his family.</p><p>His wife, Leticia, acknowledged his loss in a social media post in which she expressed her sorrow and thanked everyone for their support.</p><p>Many of Demuth’s friends and other riders paid homage to him after his passing, praising both his talent and his kind and giving character.</p><p>In addition to being a devoted father and husband who prioritized his family, he was remembered as a passionate competitor who always gave it his all on the track.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, David Bennent, Sal Capaccio, Isabel Arraiza and Elijah Nelson Clark."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":24}{"1":26,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":38}{"1":40,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":54}{"1":59,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":78}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/david-bennent/"}{"1":24}{"1":26,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/sal-capaccio/"}{"1":38}{"1":40,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/isabel-arraiza/"}{"1":54}{"1":59,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/elijah-nelson-clark/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>David Bennent</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sal Capaccio</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Isabel Arraiza</a> and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Elijah Nelson Clark</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Motorcross Racer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Brenda Lazaro | Wikipedia And Age</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Khloe Bbnaija Leaked Video | Bedroom Tape and Scandal</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfn7y0tIydnKatpJ16uLXFnmSlnaSesKqtjJ2cpq2knXqktMilm6udnmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./queen-margrethe-ii.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Queen Margrethe II">&larr;
