They thought it was a wild overreaction. There were a lot of the people on the outside who thought it was an overreaction. That it was an HR matter.</p><p>“I think for this team and talking with management, they never got any more answers than the public was getting on this. That doesn’t mean they haven’t accepted Joe Mazzulla as head coach, but this is a team that really believed in Ime Udoka and had a strong connection with him.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Head Coach Ime Udoka of the Boston Celtics high fives Sam Hauser #30 after Game One of the 2022 NBA Finals on June 2, 2022 at Chase Center in San Francisco, California. <span class=credit>NBAE via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Udoka — who was in a 13-year relationship with actress Nia Long at the time — was entering his second season as head coach after he led Boston to the NBA Finals in 2022, when it fell to the Warriors in six games.</p><p>“I think there were a couple instances this season where a lot of that angst resurfaced,” Wojnarowski said. “First, when the Brooklyn Nets nearly hired Udoka as head coach, and then when the Rockets did.
